# Outline:

- A simplistic scraper that cleans up data regarding share prices for a list of pre-defined shares or all shares based on daily NSE reports. It can find data for multiple parameters based on the users preference and stores the data neatly in an excel sheet, presenting date and the data for the parameters. It is soon going to be updated to include rudimentary analysis and visualisation as well.
